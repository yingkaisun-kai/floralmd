/// Delete drift round 6 (issue #156, 2026-07-03 22:13 log): a bypassed
/// deletion (drag-move whose drop lands nowhere) skips TextKit 2's selection
/// fixup along with didChangeText. The queued fixup then fires at the next
/// `endEditing` — the heal's attribute-only restyle — via
/// `_fixSelectionAfterChangeInCharacterRange`, mapping the stale selection
/// against post-edit coordinates and leaping the caret (~two wrapped lines
/// forward in the field report). The heal must both collapse the selection to
/// the edit point before syncing and re-assert it after, because the late
/// fixer moves even a freshly set valid caret.

    ## Introduction
    Everyone has heard about Calculus. However, not nearly as much people \
    will have its counterpart - discrete calculus, also known as graph theory.

    Nowadays, discrete calculus is widely used in various applied sciences. \
    One of its potential uses is ranking. See Sizemore, Strang et al., and Xu et al.

    Here, we apply Hodgerank to college admissions data
