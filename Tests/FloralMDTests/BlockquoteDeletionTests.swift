/// Regression: characters in a callout / block quote must stay deletable.
///
/// Each rendered block becomes one NSTextBlock ("table cell"), and NSTextView
/// refuses `deleteBackward` at the boundary between two adjacent cells. When
/// block-quote lines were split per line, deleting toward a line end silently
/// did nothing. Merging a quote's lines into one block (one cell) fixes it —
/// this test runs the real, laid-out delete path in a window to catch it.
