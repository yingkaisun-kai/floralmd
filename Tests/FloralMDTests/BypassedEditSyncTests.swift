/// Regression tests for the round-4 "delete drift" (issue #156): AppKit's
/// drag-move source deletion runs shouldChangeText → replaceCharacters but
/// never calls didChangeText, so rawSource/blocks silently freeze. Every later
/// edit then does offset math against the stale model (the caret leap) and
/// autosave writes the stale rawSource. The fix schedules a check from
/// shouldChangeText: a pendingEdit still unconsumed on the next run-loop pass
/// means didChangeText was bypassed, and the editor heals by running the sync
/// didChangeText would have run.
