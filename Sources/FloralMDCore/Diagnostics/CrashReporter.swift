// MARK: - Crash report uploading
//
// Opt-in (default off), best-effort uploading of the crash reports macOS writes
// for FloralMD. On launch — when the user has enabled it — we read the per-user
// `.ips` reports the OS dropped in ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ and POST any
// we haven't sent before.
//
// Why read `.ips` files rather than MetricKit's `MXCrashDiagnostic`? It's the
// simplest path that yields the *full* report (not just a call-stack payload),
// is available immediately on the next launch, and needs no framework wiring.
// The tradeoff: it relies on direct filesystem access, which only works because
// FloralMD is **not sandboxed** (no entitlements file). If App Sandbox is ever
// adopted, this directory becomes unreadable and we'd switch to MetricKit.
//
// PII note: `.ips` reports embed the user's home path (and so their account
// name), the device model, and the OS version. We send them as-is — acceptable
// for crash-fix use, which the Settings note states plainly. Revisit if scope
// changes.
