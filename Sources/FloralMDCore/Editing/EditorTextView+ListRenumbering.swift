// MARK: - Ordered List Renumbering
//
// Keeps a contiguous run of ordered ("1. ", "1) ") list items sequential
// after an edit changes its item count (insert mid-list, delete an item,
// paste). Scoped to the nesting depth the edit touched — sibling depths and
// unrelated lists elsewhere in the document are never rewritten. Called once
// per edit from `syncRawSourceFromDisplay` (EditorTextView+EditFlow.swift),
// after `blocks` has been reparsed to the post-edit state.
